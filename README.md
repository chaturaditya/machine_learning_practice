Trying to implement common ML algorithms in python (without ready-made libraries)

Some of these are my solutions to coursework questions from Imperial College London. Courses include: [(395) Machine Learning](https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/courses/machine-learning-course-395/), [(496) Maths for Machine Learning](http://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/sml/teaching/mathematics-for-machine-learning-autumn-2016/) and [(493) Data Analysis and Probabilistic Inference](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/current-students/courses/493/)
